This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model to classify road conditions, including Left Turns, Right Turns, Straight Roads, and Landslides, from images. The dataset is manually labeled using Roboflow and includes images with bounding boxes around the road conditions.


Dataset Creation: Images are manually annotated on Roboflow.
Training YOLOv8: The model is trained on the labeled dataset to detect road conditions.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated on validation images to measure accuracy and performance.
Inference: The trained model can be used to make predictions on new road images.
